This is an E-commerce website selling downloadable digital products. A Paypal button is integrated for the payment. ReactJS is used as the frontend framework while ExpressJS works as the backend framework. The website connects with Mongo DB (through Mongoose) as the remote database server (see the source code for this logic [**here**](https://github.com/LiboBearChen/shop/tree/master/server/routes)).

The project consists of client-side and server-side. Redux is used on the client-side for managing user states (see the source code for this logic [**here**](https://github.com/LiboBearChen/shop/tree/master/client/src/_reducers)). Models for payments, products, and users are built on the server-side (see the source code for this logic [**here**](https://github.com/LiboBearChen/shop/tree/master/server/models)).

This is a complex project and many details are being improved. Although it has been deployed, errors may occur when browsing the website.
